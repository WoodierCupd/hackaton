<h1>Hackaton Laravel chess project</h1>
<h3>A basic laravel chess application</h3>
<p>The chess application has a basic Breeze auth system. After you log in you can play chess agains a bot. You can choose your color and a difficulty.</p>
<p>This project was made within 12 hours of programming in a school event called Hackaton. After the 12 hours I made the project a bit more polished.</p>
<h5>I used the following chess related packages in this project</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md">chess.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chessboardjs.com/index.html#start">chessboard.js</a></li>
